uname is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to obtain information about the system's kernel and operating system. When executed with the appropriate options, it can provide various pieces of information such as the system name, network node hostname, kernel release, kernel version, processor type, hardware platform, operating system, and more. Some common options for uname include -a to display all available information, -s to display the system name, and -r to display the kernel release.
